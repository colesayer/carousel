Take-Home Assignment - Carousel

Summary

Having a ready-made Javascript library to execute a carousel on a webpage is taken for granted these days. However, using one means relying on someone else's technology to make sure your site is running smoothly. In this scenario, we'd like you to pretend for a moment that using another library isn't an option. To the best of your ability, and using the carousel experience found on attached mov files as a guide for functionality, we'd like you to replicate the experience from scratch.

The expected turnaround time is one week from confirmed receipt of this exercise.

Judgement Criteria

You are simply executing on the business logic. No efficiencies are expected. Like in the real world, this is the part of the development where perfecting and nailing down the functionality is the priority. Don't concern yourself with the amount of lines or Big O here; we want to see how you thought this out. There shouldn't be any obvious bugs.
